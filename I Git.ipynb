    "\n",
    "1. `git clone` the remote repo we are working on to **initiate the project** on your computer.\n",

    "    1. make sure you are on `master` branch when you run\n",
    "    1. *reminder*: `origin` is default alias for our repo SSH. automatically set during clone, so don't worry about setting this.\n",
    "    1. should be ran whenever changes are made to `master` branch in remote repo\n",
    "        1. e.g. if someone updates the master branch (typically the lead, who's making the merges), you want to run this line to update your code as well.\n",
    "        1. you should usually still be able to make changes if you don't pull right away, but you should want to see the latest updates.\n",
    "1. `git checkout -b [new_branch]`: **make changes / update code** on local repo. do this on a new branch.\n",
    "    1. `add/commit` changes, but *don't merge* these changes onto the `master` branch yet.\n",
    "1. `git push origin [new_branch]`: **push new branch to remote** repo where the lead can review the changes and merge the `new_branch` onto the `master` branch\n",
    "1. **Repeat steps 2-4** to make new changes.\n",
    "    1. Remember to pull to see changes (step 2).\n",
    "    1. *Note*: the non-master branch that is pushed might be deleted after it is merged in the remote repo. If so, just create a new branch to make more changes (step 3). Ideally, name the branch after its purpose (e.g. `acquire_update`)"
